While printing parts for my [Mostly-Printed-CNC](https://www.v1engineering.com/assembly/)
I wasn't quite sure if my filament would be enough to print all the parts.

That's why I created a small spreadsheet that calculates the amount of filament needed for 
a two color print with the recommended printing parameters.
It can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14juQamppz52qrJNiCwMI9-A8T8e4JEK98DszS8Fe2Mc/edit?usp=sharing).

To edit the file click on File -> Create Copy.

The color codes on the left are exchangeable. For example, if you got more black than 
white filament (like I did), it is possible to adjust the color of the parts so that
everything is printable with the amount of filament available.

Every part that has been successfully printed and entered into the list is subtracted from
the sum of needed filament.
